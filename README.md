## Yes, We Can!

#### A resource site for people who collect cans and bottles for a living.

#### By **Anne Belka**


## Description
This project was generated in VisualStudio utilizing the mapbox.js API with data from Civic Apps. A map is displayed with garbage collection areas.  A user can click on an area to find that area's garbage night. In addition BottleDrop locations are marked, as well as colleges and universities which typically produce a lot of bottles and cans. A messages section allows people to let canners know when they expect to have a lot of cans to pick up (for instance, after a party.)
